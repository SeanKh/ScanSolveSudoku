## About
This is the code for my bachelor thesis which was under the title "Detection, Identification and Automated Solution of Logic Puzzles on a Mobile Application using Image Processing, Classification and Backtracking algorithms".

Logic puzzles help people to sharpen their mental ability skills such as numerical memory, attention to details and thinking process. It is well-known that Sudoku brings state of calmness and sense of order due to the fact that this game gives a chance to change a focus and relax from the surrounding world. It is widely practiced to include Sudoku puzzles in the daily routine owing to the reason that solving Sudoku refreshes mind and helps to complete other tasks with restored state of mind and energy.

## Structure

The code is divided into 3 major parts(Image Processing, ML, Backtracking algorithms):

 - java files for Image Processing using OpenCV library
 - files for the Classification work done(models are in assets/*, usage is in */SudokuSolver/*)
 - files for the Backtracking algorithm implementations.

apart from the general structure, the code is throughly documented.
